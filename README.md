# Blog Project

## Overview
The **Blog Project** is a full-stack application that allows users to register, log in, and manage blogs with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality. The application is built using **Angular** for the frontend, **Node.js** for the backend, and **MySQL** as the database.

## Features
